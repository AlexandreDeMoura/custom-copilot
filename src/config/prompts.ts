# Task Management Guide
<br />

This guide will help you organize and prioritize tasks using simple techniques.
<br />

## 1. Task Prioritization
<br />

Organize tasks by importance and urgency. The **Eisenhower Matrix** is a helpful tool for categorizing tasks into four quadrants:
<br />

- **Important & Urgent**: Do these tasks first.
<br />
- **Important but Not Urgent**: Schedule these for later.
<br />
- **Not Important but Urgent**: Delegate these if possible.
<br />
- **Not Important & Not Urgent**: Consider eliminating these tasks.
<br />

## 2. Task Breakdown
<br />

Break down complex tasks into smaller, actionable steps. For example:
<br />

- Write an article:
<br />
  - Research the topic
<br />
  - Outline key points
<br />
  - Write the draft
<br />
  - Edit and proofread
<br />
  - Publish the article
